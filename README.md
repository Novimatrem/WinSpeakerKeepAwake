# WinSpeakerKeepAwake

A Windows, Python script that plays an inaudible tone to keep those types of annoying speakers awake when no sound is playing.

In the case it isn't working, simply create via Copy-Paste a SECOND WinSpeakerKeepAwake.pyw inside of shell:startup - it will be equally as inaudible to you, but more audible to your speakers. Add more copies of WinSpeakerKeepAwake.pyw to shell:startup as needed until your speaker stops turning off automatically.

The Python code in this repository was vibe coded by myself and Microsoft Copilot AI. This is the first time I ever tried such a thing. If this is repulsive to you, I understand, simply do not use or engage with the script. The reason I resorted to such a method for the first time in my life, is that it wasn't my damn fucking fault that I had to migrate to Windows, and I had absolutely no desire to engage with the operating system beyond where I was forced to, so putting more effort than was required out of me to make this essential component of my setup work wasn't going to happen. I'm not putting passion into something for Windows, by Microsoft. I vibe coded this out of a disrespect for Windows, Microsoft, and software designed to run on it exclusively. I wasn't going to put my own passion and effort into something for this operating system that I wish to die in a fire. Windows sucks ass. Switch to Linux, script things in Bash, have a better life than the shitty circumstance I've been forced into.
